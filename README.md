# STUMP - STUdent Meet uP app. 

We are here to help you find students to study with. 

This is a JavaScript based application that uses FIrebase, Google Maps and Places API to help students find study groups.

First you create an account and then you can either create a STUMP or join a STUMP.

The application uses your location to find coffee shops with wifi nearby. 

Once you settle on a location you can select a time and date to meet up. 

When a meetup has been established a Slack notifications is sent out.
